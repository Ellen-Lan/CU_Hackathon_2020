# CU_Hackathon_2020
This repository holds the coding for our hackathon submission, as well as the final presentation. We gave insights into COVID-19 school closings and reopenings internationally, as well as how COVID-19 has changed different types of mobility within America at the state level. Our entry won first place for Columbia University's 6th Annual Data Science Society Hack-A-Thon (2020).
